# An-Optimized-A-Algorithm-with-Weighted-Heuristics
Pathfinding is a critical task in robotics, gaming,
and AI, requiring algorithms that are both efficient and accurate.
Among these, the A* algorithm is a cornerstone for its balance
between optimality and computational efficiency. This paper
presents an in-depth analysis comparing the classic A* algorithm
with an enhanced variant, employing weighted heuristics and
early stopping techniques to optimize performance. We eval-
uate both methods across multiple randomized environments,
analyzing metrics such as computational time, path length,
explored nodes, and success rates. Experimental results reveal
that the enhanced algorithm achieves significant improvements
in computational efficiency while maintaining path optimality,
making it a viable choice for real-time applications.
